We face risks arising from restructuring of our operations and uncertainty with respect to our ability to achieve any anticipated cost savings associated with such restructuring.
We continuously assess opportunities to streamline operations and fuel long-term profitable growth. Future charges related to such actions may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.
In July 2020, we announced a plan to implement a reduction in workforce in response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, we announced the next step of our restructuring initiative, which included realignment of our top level organization to support our new strategies, which became effective in 2021. The next phase of the reorganization, including the streamlining of operations, is expected to be completed in 2021. The initiative included the elimination of approximately 15% of our global non-retail and non-manufacturing employee population.
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur charges related to this reduction in workforce during the next 12 months, which may harm our profitability in the periods incurred.
Implementation of this reduction in workforce, or any similar future restructuring program actions, presents a number of significant risks, including:
•actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to customers and consumers;
•potential adverse effects on our internal control environment and inability to preserve adequate internal controls relating to our general and administrative functions in connection with the decision to outsource certain business service activities;
•actual or perceived disruption to suppliers, distribution networks and other important operational relationships and the inability to resolve potential conflicts in a timely manner;
•difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality from our contract manufacturers;
•diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and strategic objectives; and
•failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees.
Because of these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will fully realize the purpose and anticipated operational benefits or cost savings of any global productivity actions and, if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, there may be a failure to achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings and efficiency as a result of the reduction in workforce, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, additional restructuring or reorganization activities may be required in the future.
Any major disruption or failure of our information technology systems, or our failure to successfully implement new technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and operations.
We rely on various information technology systems, owned by us and third parties, to manage our operations. Over the last several years, we have been and continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. For example, over the next several years, we plan to continue the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system across the company. These activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and upgrading these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems or of integrating new or upgraded systems into our current systems. Our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new or upgraded technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.
As we outsource functions, we become more dependent on the entities performing those functions. Disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations.
As part of our long-term profitable growth strategy, we are continually looking for opportunities to provide essential business services in a more cost-effective manner. In some cases, this requires the outsourcing of functions or parts of functions that can be performed more effectively by external service providers. For example, we currently outsource a significant portion of our information technology, finance, customer relations and customer service functions to Wipro Limited. While we believe we conduct appropriate diligence before entering into agreements with any outsourcing entity, the failure of one or more of such entities to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, compliance with data protection and privacy laws, providing services on a timely basis or providing services at the prices we expect, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For example, our outsourcing entities and other third-party service providers may experience difficulties, disruptions, delays, or failures in their ability to deliver services to us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We could face increased costs or disruption associated with finding replacement vendors or hiring new employees in order to return these services in-house, which may have a significant impact on the cost and timing of receipt of inventory for future seasons. We may outsource other functions in the future, which would increase our reliance on third parties.
