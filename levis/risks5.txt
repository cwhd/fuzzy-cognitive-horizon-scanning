We are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally, which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as political and economic risks.
A significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated internationally. In addition, a substantial amount of our products comes from sources outside the country of distribution. As a result, we are both directly and indirectly (through our suppliers) subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:
•currency fluctuations, which have impacted our results of operations significantly in recent years;
•political, economic and social instability;
•changes in tariffs and taxes;
•regulatory restrictions on our ability to operate in our preferred manner;
•rapidly changing regulatory restrictions and requirements, for example in the area of data privacy; and
•less protective foreign laws relating to intellectual property.
The functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, including debt, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Foreign governmental policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions.
Furthermore, due to our global operations, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, such as those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, antitrust and competition, environmental protection, consumer protection, privacy, and anti-corruption, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have put into place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements. Violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.
We also are subject to the impacts of political, economic and social instability. For example, in January 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. The consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and related changes to trade and tax policy could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Brexit has also contributed to volatility and uncertainty in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and such volatility could continue to occur.
Changes to trade policy, including tariff and customs regulations, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. For example, the Trump Administration instituted and proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on U.S. imports, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.
As a result of recent policy changes and proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. New tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that could be impacted by changes to U.S. and international trade policies (including governmental action related to tariffs, sanctions and trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The enactment of tax reform legislation, including legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.
Legislation or other changes in US and international tax laws could increase our liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act had a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax assets. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate, eliminated or limited the deduction of several expenses that were previously deductible, imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries, requires a minimum tax on earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries and permits a tax-free repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividends received deduction. We completed our evaluation of the overall impact of the Tax Act on our effective tax rate and balance sheet through the fiscal year 2018 and reflected the amounts in our financial statements. The Tax Act, as well as regulations and legal decisions interpreting and applying the Tax Act, may have significant impacts in future periods.
If we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected.
We rely on both company-owned and third-party distribution facilities to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce consumers throughout the world. As part of the pursuit for improved organizational agility and marketplace responsiveness, we have consolidated the number of distribution facilities we rely upon and continue to look for opportunities for further consolidation in certain regions. Such consolidation may make our operations more vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages or disruption (including as a consequence of public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures imposed by governments), labor disputes, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the impacts of climate change, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting these distribution centers. In addition, distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from their distribution facilities, which also may be adversely affected by work stoppages or disruption, labor disputes and pandemics. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, whether company-owned or third-party, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected.
Unexpected obstacles in new markets in our existing markets may limit our expansion opportunities and cause our business and growth to suffer.
Our future growth depends in part on our continued expansion efforts in existing markets and in new markets where we may have limited familiarity and experience with regulatory environments and market practices. In particular, one of our key strategies is to further diversify our portfolio and grow market share across geographies, categories, genders and channels. We may not be able to expand or successfully operate in those markets, categories and channels as a result of unfamiliarity or other unexpected barriers to expansion or entry. For example, in connection with our efforts, we may encounter obstacles, including new competitors, cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, economic or governmental instability, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and differences in consumer tastes and preferences. Our failure to develop our business in new markets or disappointing growth in existing markets that we may experience could harm our business and results of operations.
