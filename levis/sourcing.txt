Sourcing and Logistics
Organization.  Our global sourcing and logistics organizations are responsible for taking a product from the design concept stage through production to delivery to our customers. Our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve product development and sourcing efficiencies and reduce total product and distribution costs while maintaining our focus on product quality, local service levels and working capital management. Our presence in more than 110 countries enables us to leverage our global scale for product development and sourcing while using our local expertise to tailor products and retail experiences to individual markets. Our integrated production development and distribution platform enables us to achieve operating efficiencies and deliver superior quality products.
Product procurement.  We source nearly all of our products through independent contract manufacturers. We may have minimum inventory purchase commitments, including fabric commitments, with suppliers that secure a portion of material needs for future seasons. The remainder is sourced from our company-operated manufacturing and finishing plants. See "Item 2 – Properties" for more information about these manufacturing facilities.
Sources and availability of raw materials.  The principal fibers used in our products include cotton, synthetics and man-made cellulosics that are used to produce fabrics of 100% composition or blends. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors. The price fluctuations impact the cost of our products in future seasons due to the lead time of our product development cycle. Fluctuations in product costs can cause a decrease in our profitability if product pricing actions taken in response are insufficient or if those actions cause our wholesale customers or retail consumers to reduce the volumes they purchase.
Sourcing locations.  We use numerous independent contract manufacturers located throughout the world for the production and finishing of our garments. We conduct assessments of political, social, environmental, economic, trade, labor and intellectual property protection conditions in the countries in which we source our products before placing production in those countries and on an ongoing basis. We also monitor ongoing global trade regulations to optimize our supply chain networks in response to changes in tariffs or other trade policies around the world.
In fiscal year 2020, we sourced products from independent contract manufacturers located in approximately 24 countries around the world, including the United States. We sourced products in North and South Asia, the Americas, Europe and Africa. No single country accounted for more than 20% of our sourcing in fiscal year 2020.
Sourcing practices.  Our sourcing practices include these elements:
•We require all third-party vendors, including licensees and their authorized subcontractors, who manufacture or finish products for us to contribute to our sustainability goals and to follow all established policies and guidelines. They must comply with our code of conduct relating to supplier working conditions as well as environmental, employment and sourcing practices.
•Our supplier code of conduct covers employment practices such as wages and benefits, working hours, health and safety, working age and discriminatory practices, environmental matters such as wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal, and ethical and legal conduct. We regularly evaluate and refine our code of conduct processes.
•We regularly assess manufacturing and finishing facilities against our code of conduct through periodic on-site facility inspections and improvement activities, including use of independent monitors to supplement our internal staff. We integrate review and performance results into our sourcing decisions. We encourage collaboration among apparel companies in factory monitoring and improvement.
•We regularly disclose the names and locations of our vendors to provide transparency into our supply chain. We regularly evaluate and refine our code of conduct processes.
Logistics.  We use company-operated and third-party distribution facilities to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce customers. For more information, see "Item 2 – Properties." Distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our contract manufacturers and plants, inspecting those products, preparing them for retail presentation, and shipping them to our customers and to our own stores. Our distribution centers maintain a combination of replenishment and seasonal inventory. In certain locations around the globe, we have consolidated our distribution centers to service multiple countries.
