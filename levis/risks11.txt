Risks Relating to Our Industry
Our revenues are influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending and consumer confidence.
Apparel is a cyclical industry that is dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending and consumer confidence. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected, there is economic uncertainty or volatility or during recessionary periods. Our wholesale customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by closing doors, reducing inventories, canceling orders or increasing promotional activity. Our brand-dedicated stores are also affected by these conditions, which may lead to a decline in consumer traffic and spending in these stores. As a result, factors that diminish consumer spending and confidence in any of the markets in which we compete, particularly deterioration in general economic conditions, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tourism and tourist spending, volatility in investment returns, fear of unemployment, increases in energy costs or tax or interest rates, housing market downturns, fear about and impact of pandemic illness, (such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), and other factors such as acts of war, natural disasters or terrorist or political events that impact consumer confidence, could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition through their impact on our wholesale customers as well as direct sales.
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, related restrictions on travel and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, and the extent of any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. For example, as the number of people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the disease and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine may continue to increase, which will adversely affect traffic to our and our customer's stores. Any significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our and our customer's stores caused by COVID-19 would result in a loss of sales and profits and other adverse effects. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could adversely affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition.
Intense competition in the global apparel industry could lead to reduced sales and prices.
We face a variety of competitive challenges in the global apparel industry from a variety of companies, and competition has increased over the years due to factors such as:
•the international expansion and increased presence of vertically integrated specialty stores;
•expansion into e-commerce by existing and new competitors;
•the proliferation of private labels and exclusive brands offered by department stores, chain stores and mass channel retailers;
•the introduction of lines of jeans, athleisure and casual apparel by well-known and successful athletic wear companies; and
•the transition of apparel companies who traditionally relied on wholesale distribution channels into their own retail distribution network.
In addition, some of these competitors have greater financial, supply, distribution and marketing resources and may be able to adapt to changes in consumer preferences or retail requirements more quickly or devote greater resources to the building and sustaining of their brand equity and the marketing and sale of their products both in stores and online. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to achieve lower product costs or adopt more aggressive pricing and discounting policies. As a result, we may not be able to compete as effectively with them and may not be able to maintain or grow the demand for our products. Failure to compete effectively due to these factors could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
The success of our business depends upon our ability to forecast and respond timely to consumer demand and market conditions and offer on-trend and new and updated products at attractive price points.
The global apparel industry is characterized by ever-changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication, and by the rapid replication of new products by competitors. The apparel industry is also impacted by changing consumer preferences regarding spending categories generally, including shifts away from traditional consumer spending and towards "experiential" spending and sustainable products. As a result, our success depends in large part on our ability to develop, market and deliver innovative and stylish products at a pace, intensity and price competitive with other brands in the markets in which we sell our products. In addition, we must create products at a range of price points that appeal to the consumers of both our wholesale customers and our dedicated retail stores and e-commerce sites situated in each of our diverse geographic regions. Our development and production cycles take place prior to full visibility into all of these factors for the coming seasons. Failure on our part to forecast and respond timely to consumer demand and market conditions and to regularly and rapidly develop innovative and stylish products and update core products could limit sales growth, adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and negatively impact the consumer traffic in our dedicated retail stores. In addition, if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels, which may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices. This could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and could adversely affect our gross margins. For example, if sales do not meet expectations because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and consumer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages, which could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. Moreover, our newer products may not produce as high a gross margin as our traditional products and thus may have an adverse effect on our overall margins and profitability.
The global apparel industry is subject to intense cost and pricing pressure.
The apparel industry is characterized by low barriers to entry for both suppliers and marketers, global sourcing through suppliers located throughout the world, trade liberalization, continuing movement of product sourcing to lower cost countries, regular promotional activity, and the ongoing emergence of new competitors with widely varying strategies and resources. These factors have contributed, and may continue to contribute in the future, to intense pricing pressure and uncertainty throughout the supply chain. Pricing pressure has been exacerbated by the variability of raw materials in recent years. This pressure could have adverse effects on our business and financial condition, including:
•reduced gross margins across our product lines and distribution channels;
•increased retailer demands for allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support; and
•increased pressure on us to reduce our production costs and operating expenses.
Increases in the price or availability of raw materials could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.
The principal fabrics used in our products include cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation, sanctions and policy, economic climates, market speculation compliance with our working condition, environmental protection, and other standards, and other unpredictable factors. For example, compliance with the recent sanctions and trade orders issued by the U.S. government related to entities and individuals who are connected to the Xinjiang region of China could affect the sourcing and availability of raw materials, including cotton, used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. Any and all of these factors may be exacerbated by global climate change. Cotton prices suffered from unprecedented variability and uncertainty in prior years and may fluctuate significantly again in the future. In the event of a significant disruption or unavailability in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. In addition, prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in the regions where our contract manufacturers are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. Fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. Increases in raw material costs or wage rates, unless sufficiently offset by our pricing actions, may cause a decrease in our profitability and negatively impact our sales volume. These factors may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers.
