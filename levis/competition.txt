Competition
The global apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented. It is characterized by low barriers to entry, brands targeted at specific consumer segments, many regional and local competitors, and an increasing number of global competitors. Principal competitive factors include:
•anticipating and responding to changing consumer preferences and buying trends in a timely manner, and ensuring product availability at wholesale and DTC channels;
•developing high-quality, innovative products with relevant designs, fits, finishes, fabrics, style and performance features that meet consumer desires and trends;
•maintaining favorable and strong brand name recognition and appeal through strong and effective marketing support and consumer intelligence in diverse market segments;
•identifying and securing desirable new retail locations and presenting products effectively at company-operated retail and franchised and other brand-dedicated stores;
•ensuring high-profile product placement at retailers;
•anticipating and responding to consumer expectations regarding e-commerce shopping and shipping;
•optimizing supply chain cost efficiencies and product development cycle lead times;
•creating products at a range of price points that appeal to the consumers of both our wholesale customers and our dedicated retail stores and e-commerce sites situated in each of our geographic regions; and
•generating competitive economics for wholesale customers, including retailers, franchisees, and licensees.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
We face competition from a broad range of competitors at the global, regional and local levels in diverse channels across a wide range of retail price points, and some of our competitors are larger and have more resources in the markets in which we operate. Our primary competitors include vertically integrated specialty stores, jeanswear brands, khakiwear brands, athletic wear companies, retailers' private or exclusive labels, and certain e-commerce sites.
