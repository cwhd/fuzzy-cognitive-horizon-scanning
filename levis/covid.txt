COVID-19 Impact on our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted our business and results of operations in fiscal year 2020. Many of our company-operated stores and wholesale customer doors were temporarily closed for various periods of time during the year, with the majority of the impact occurring in the second quarter when the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit globally. Recently, during our fourth quarter, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases has resulted in the temporary re-closure and reduced operating hours of some of our stores, mainly in Europe.
Throughout the pandemic, our top priority has been to protect the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. In March 2020, we temporarily closed many of our corporate offices and other facilities, and implemented an interim work from home policy for many of our corporate employees that, in most cases, we are still continuing to follow. As company-operated retail stores were re-opened, we followed local health guidelines, as well as internally derived specific health-related criteria with an emphasis on comprehensive safety precautions, including frequent cleaning in our stores and limiting the number of shoppers to allow for social distancing.
As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact, we are focused on the areas that will drive value and enable us to emerge stronger on the other side, including elevating our brand, investing in digital tools and capabilities, and accelerating our efforts to diversify across geographies, product categories and distribution channels, including our direct-to-consumer and digital businesses.
