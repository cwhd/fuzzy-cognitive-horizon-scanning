Dedicated Stores and E-commerce Sites
We believe retail stores dedicated to our brands are important for the growth, visibility, availability and commercial success of our brands, and they are an increasingly important part of our "DTC First" strategy. Our brand-dedicated stores are either operated by us or by independent third parties such as franchisees. In addition to the dedicated stores, we maintain brand-dedicated e-commerce sites that sell products directly to consumers. Company-operated brick-and-mortar retail stores.  Our company-operated retail stores, comprising both mainline and outlet stores, generated 25%, 27% and 26% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of November 29, 2020, we had 1,042 company-operated stores, predominantly Levi's® stores, located in 36 countries across our three regions. We had 359 of these stores in the Americas, 356 stores in Europe and 327 stores in Asia. During 2020, we added 175 company-operated stores and closed 38 stores.
Franchised and other stores.  Franchised, licensed, or other forms of brand-dedicated stores operated by independent third parties sell Levi's® and Dockers® products in markets outside the United States. There were approximately 1,300 of these stores as of November 29, 2020, and they are a key element of our international distribution. In addition to these stores, we consider our network of brand-dedicated shop-in-shops, which are located within department stores and may be either operated directly by us or third parties, to be an important component of our retail distribution in international markets. Outside the United States, approximately 200 of these shop-in-shops were operated by third parties as of November 29, 2020.
E-commerce sites. We maintain brand-dedicated e-commerce sites, including www.levi.com and www.dockers.com, that sell products directly to consumers across multiple markets around the world. These sites represented 8%, 5% and 4% of overall net revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018; and 21%, 14% and 13% of DTC channel net revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Seasonality of Sales
We typically achieve our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth quarter. In fiscal year 2020, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 34%, 11%, 24% and 31%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, net revenues were adversely impacted by temporary store closures and reduced traffic and consumer demand, with the majority of the impact occurring in the second quarter when most company-operated and wholesale customer doors were temporarily closed. In the fourth quarter, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases led to the temporary closure of some of our stores, predominantly in Europe. In fiscal year 2019, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 25%, 23%, 25% and 27%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year.
We typically achieve a significant amount of revenues from our DTC channel on the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, which is commonly referred to as Black Friday. Due to the timing of our fiscal year end, a particular fiscal year might include one, two or no Black Fridays, which could impact our net revenues for the fiscal year. Fiscal year 2018 included one Black Friday. Fiscal year 2019 did not have a Black Friday, while fiscal year 2020 had two Black Fridays.
We use a 52- or 53- week fiscal year, with each fiscal year ending on the Sunday that is closest to November 30 of that year. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have fiscal years ending November 30. Each fiscal year generally consists of four 13-week quarters, with each quarter ending on the Sunday that is closest to the last day of the month of that quarter. Fiscal year 2020 was a 53-week year, ending on November 29, 2020, and fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years, ending on November 24, 2019 and November 25, 2018, respectively. Each quarter of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of 13 weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2020, which consisted of 14 weeks.
The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season, but they could also be impacted by other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events, including pandemics such as COVID-19.
Effects of Inflation
We believe inflation in the regions where most of our sales occur has not had a significant effect on our net revenues or profitability.
