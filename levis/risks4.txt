If we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.
While e-commerce still comprises a small portion of our net revenues, it has been our fastest growing business over the last several years and it is a key part of our “DTC First” strategy. The success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce usage, both domestically and abroad, and promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our wholesale customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly e-commerce platforms could negatively impact our consumers’ shopping experience, resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our e-commerce business, sales from our retail stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where e-commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.
We are also vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce sites, including:
•changes in required technology interfaces;
•website downtime and other technical failures;
•costs and technical issues from website software upgrades;
•data and system security;
•computer viruses; and
•changes in applicable federal and state regulations.
In addition, we must keep up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, which may increase our costs and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers. For example, it is possible that consumers may not sign up for our loyalty program at anticipated rates if they do not find the features and benefits compelling, and that we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from these programs. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.
Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on their timely receipt of our products. The efficient flow of our products requires that our company-operated and third-party operated distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the growth of our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facilities or in our relationships with the third parties who operate the facilities, or if any such facilities were to shut down or be limited in capacity for any reason, including as a result of fire, other natural disaster, labor disruption, or pandemic (including as a consequence of public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), we could face shortages of inventory, resulting in "out of stock" conditions in the e-commerce sites we operate and those operated by our wholesale customers or other third parties, and we could experience disruption or delay, or incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our consumers and experience dissatisfaction from our consumers. Any of these issues could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.
We may be unable to maintain or increase our sales through our third-party distribution channels.
In addition to our brand-dedicated company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites, our third-party distribution channels include department stores, specialty retailers, mass channel retailers, franchised or other brand-dedicated stores, and shop-in-shops.
We may be unable to maintain or increase sales of our products through these distribution channels for several reasons, including the following:
•the retailers in these channels maintain– and seek to grow– substantial private-label and exclusive offerings as they strive to differentiate the brands and products they offer from those of their competitors;
•the retailers change their apparel strategies in a way that shifts focus away from our typical consumer or that otherwise results in a reduction of sales of our products generally, such as a reduction of fixture spaces devoted to our products or a shift to other brands; •other channels, including vertically-integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites, account for a substantial portion of jeanswear and casual wear sales. In some of our mature markets, these stores and sites have placed competitive pressure on our primary distribution channels, and many of these stores and sites are now looking to our developing markets to grow their business; and
•shrinking points of distribution, including fewer doors at our customer locations, store closures and decreased foot traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or bankruptcy or financial difficulties of a customer.
Further success by retailer private-labels, vertically-integrated specialty stores and e-commerce sites may continue to adversely affect the sales of our products across all channels, as well as the profitability of our brand-dedicated stores. Additionally, our ability to secure or maintain retail floor space, product display prominence, market share and sales in these channels depends on our ability to offer differentiated products, to increase retailer profitability on our products and the strength of our brands, and such efforts could have an adverse impact on our margins.
In addition, the retail industry in the United States has experienced substantial consolidation over the last decade, and further consolidation may occur. Consolidation in the retail industry has typically resulted in store closures, centralized purchasing decisions and increased emphasis by retailers on inventory management and productivity, which could result in fewer stores carrying our products or reduced demand by retailers for our products. In addition, we and other suppliers may experience increased customer leverage over us and greater exposure to credit risk as a result of industry consolidation. Furthermore, consolidation may be partly due to consumers continuing to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers, which in turn exposes our products to increased competition. Any of the foregoing results can impact, and have adversely impacted in the past, our net revenues, margins and ability to operate efficiently.
