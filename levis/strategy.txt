Our Business Strategies
Our growth and financial performance over the last several years resulted from the key growth strategies our management team adopted to guide the decisions and choices that we've made. The growth and evolution of our company now requires our business strategies to evolve.
As we entered fiscal 2021, we shifted our focus to prioritize the most important areas that we believe will drive our long-term success. The following three “where to play” choices will serve as our strategic framework for what we intend to achieve:
•Brand Led: Our brands are authentic, original and loved by consumers the world over. We plan to continue to elevate and strengthen them through integrating product, design, marketing and consumer in-store experience with a global vision executed consistently across the markets where we operate. Through product and communications that drive impact and engage the hearts and minds of our consumers, we intend to maintain our existing consumers while also creating new life-long fans. Driven by conscious consumerism and denim and style leadership, our goal is to maintain market share leadership in Levi’s® men’s and grow market share in Levi’s® women’s and with youth. We believe that a critical part of this will be our continued thought leadership in areas where our values and brands go hand in hand — like equality, sustainability and civic engagement — to drive brand equity. Similarly, we will apply the same ambitions to Dockers®, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.TM and Denizen®.
•DTC First: Our direct-to-consumer ("DTC") business has grown from 20% of our net revenues in 2011 to nearly 40% of our net revenues in fiscal year 2020, and our ambition is to drive this toward 60% of our annual net revenues over the next decade. Our DTC channels allow us to connect directly with our consumers and deliver the best experience for them because we control their brand experience. As a result, we plan to accelerate investing in our stores and online platforms to elevate consumer experiences in store and online, and expand our brick-and-mortar retail footprint, with a focus on mainline expansion as a step to continue elevating the brand in key markets, to create the kind of memorable connections that make loyal fans for life, ultimately benefiting our business across all channels. One of our “DTC First” strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. We believe growth of our DTC business will be accretive to our company gross margins and improve the overall profitability of the company. Over time, we plan to operate more like a retailer and less like a wholesaler, and pivot everything we do to drive success in our stores and online.
•Further Diversify our Portfolio: We plan to further capitalize on our substantial opportunity to amplify our reach and grow share across geographies, categories, genders and channels, increasing our flexibility and resilience. We plan to continue to drive growth in our international business, with a specific focus on China. Over the next decade, we plan to achieve gender parity by driving outsized growth in women’s, as well as in our product categories beyond jeans—tops, accessories, outerwear, footwear, non-denim bottoms—which collectively we intend to comprise more than half our annual net revenues. In the wholesale channel, we plan to grow our business with partners that are growing, allowing us to unlock the opportunity to elevate the Levi’s® brand as well as increase the penetration of our value brands. We expect continued growth of the online business of our pure-play and traditional wholesale customers, leading to a total global digital footprint—inclusive of our own ecommerce business—comprising more than a third of our annual net revenues over the next decade. Finally, we will also evaluate opportunities to diversify our portfolio of brands through accretive inorganic acquisitions that make strategic and financial sense, and that are consistent with our company culture.
Our success will be driven not just by what we do, but how we do it. Our three strategic choices are supported by a foundation of the following three “how to win” choices:
•Digital Transformation: Our vision for enterprise-wide digital transformation is to create a superior consumer experience and drive profitability through digital technology, data and artificial intelligence ("AI"), and new ways of working. We plan to continue to build out key omnichannel capabilities on a global basis, upgrading and improving our digital shopping platforms globally. We also plan to adopt digital tools across the business to harness the competitive advantage our data provides — allowing us to make data and AI-informed decisions, respond more quickly to market trends and focus our time on the most strategic work. We also plan to upgrade our enterprise resource planning system in the coming years, automating and digitizing processes, while linking our enterprise systems in a seamless manner, creating a more simplified work environment. We believe all these efforts will contribute towards growing our digital footprint and higher operating margins.
•Operational Excellence: To stay one step ahead of the competition, we must continue to embrace agility, reduce complexity and execute consistently, always striving to find more streamlined ways of working. For example, we have taken and will continue to take steps to improve our speed to market calendar and agility with a focus on servicing consumer demand globally, such as creating fewer touch points as merchandise goes to market and leveraging our F.L.X. technology, which uses lasers to digitize denim finish design, to improve operational agility and improved inventory management. We expect that by simplifying the way we work and driving more efficiency and agility in responding to changes in consumer demand, we will see improved inventory turns, reduced lead times and improvements in working capital and our cash conversion cycle.
•Financial Discipline: We plan to continue to manage our costs aggressively so that we can invest in the areas that will drive growth and help us deliver Adjusted EBIT margins in excess of 12% upon net revenues recovering to pre-COVID levels. As we grow net revenues and gross margins, we plan to drive leverage on our investments, improve our structural economics across channels, and deliver returns on invested capital in the mid-teens.
